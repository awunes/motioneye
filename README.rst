Due to personal reasons [ccrisan] can no longer be actively involved with this project. If anyone is interested in taking it over, please contact [ccrisan] and [y'all will] work out together a hand-off plan."

I'm going to attempt to work on this fork and see if I can make any changes to help keep the project alive.
